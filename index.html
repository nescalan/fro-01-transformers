          <h2>Transformes G1</h2>
          <p>
            Transformers: Generation 1 (also known as Generation One or G1) is a
            toy line from 1984 to 1990, produced by Hasbro and Takara. It was a
            line of toy robots that could change into an alternate form
            (vehicles such as cars and planes, miniature guns or cassettes,
            animals, and even dinosaurs) by moving parts into other places, and
            it was the first line of toys produced for the successful
            Transformers toy and entertainment franchise. The line was
            originally called The Transformers, with "Generation 1" originating
            as a term coined by fans of the toys when the Transformers:
            Generation 2 toy line was released in 1992. Hasbro eventually
            adopted the term "Generation 1" to refer to any toy produced in that
            era.

          <h2>Development</h2>
          <p>
            In 1983, Hasbro representatives were sent to Tokyo Toy Show, a toy
            expo in Japan, in search of prospective toys that they could import
            to the North American market. At the time, Japanese toy manufacturer
            Takara was showcasing several transforming robot toys from lines
            such as Diaclone and Micro Change. Hasbro bought the rights to
            produce the toys, but decided to release them under a single brand
            to avoid confusing the market with several series with similar
            premises.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to the Hasbro deal, Takara briefly sold Diaclone toys in
            specialty toy shops in the U.S. under the "Diakron" moniker, while
            in some parts of Europe, Diaclone enjoyed a small following with a
            comic book series for that market.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hasbro had a business relationship with Marvel Comics, which had
            successfully produced the Hasbro tie-in comic book G.I. Joe: A Real
            American Hero, based on the Hasbro action figure G.I. Joe. Marvel
            was approached once again to provide a backstory for the new toy
            line. Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter created an overall story,
            and editor Bob Budiansky created names and profiles for the
            characters.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the toy line was released, it was supported by the Marvel
            Comics series, an animated television series, and a gamut of other
            merchandising tie-ins. The 1986 feature film The Transformers: The
            Movie generated $5,706,456 in the United States box offices.[2]

          <h2>Premise</h2>
          <p>
            The Transformers plot has two factions of sentient alien robots: the
            heroic Autobots and the villainous Decepticons. Both sides are from
            a race called Transformers – robots that can change into vehicles,
            mechanical devices and even animal forms. They have waged civil war
            for eons on their home planet of Cybertron, a war that had started
            several million years B.C., before humans even existed on Earth.
            Their planet of Cybertron had become decimated and both factions
            have been reduced to scavenging for needed supplies, primarily
            energy. The Autobots leave their planet on a space ship, and the
            Decepticons follow them in their own vessel. When the Decepticons
            board the Autobot ship, a battle breaks out, and with nobody
            controlling the ship, it crashes onto prehistoric Earth and knocks
            the Transformers unconscious. Millions of years later, in 1984, the
            dormant volcano the Autobot ship had crashed on becomes active. The
            eruption re-sets the ship's computer, which deploys a probe to study
            the planet. The computer learns that the planet is inhabited, and in
            order to survive first contact the computer both repairs the
            disabled Transformers and re-configures them with physical forms
            based on vehicles and machines of human origin. The Transformers are
            now able to hide by changing into vehicles or devices in case humans
            turn out to be hostile.
          </p>
          <p>
            This initial premise, in all three media of toys, TV series, and
            comics, became more cosmic in scale. More stories began to be set in
            outer space and on alien worlds, especially after The Transformers:
            The Movie.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additional story elements are also added to the series, such as
            establishing the origins of the Transformers race. A cruel and
            coldly logical race of alien squid-like creatures with five faces
            and tentacles known as Quintessons, who were the creators of the
            Autobots and Decepticons. They also created a gigantic factory that
            would become Cybertron. Eventually the design of the robots would
            become so sophisticated they developed emotions, self-awareness, and
            the machines went into rebellion, known as the 1st Cybertronian War.
            After successfully seizing control of Cybertron the robots lived in
            peace until the Decepticons could not resist or overcome their
            innate desire for military campaign and attempted a coup. The
            Autobots only overcame the Decepticons in the 2nd Cybertronian war
            by developing transformation to hide as mundane objects, vehicles,
            or tools. After copying the transformation ability of Autobots and
            creating a new leader named Megatron, the Decepticons launched into
            a 3rd Cybertronian war that would see Cybertron ruined, at which
            point the TV series begins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two characters – each the greatest leader of his side, became the
            most iconic representatives of the series: Optimus Prime of the
            Autobots and Megatron of the Decepticons. After the featured film,
            Megatron was reformed as Galvatron, and Optimus Prime was replaced
            for the majority of the third season by Rodimus Prime, only to
            return at the end. Both Optimus Prime and Megatron continued to
            appear in one form or another in subsequent Transformers series,
            where they maintained their leadership roles.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The toys of Generation 1 have seven series by year.</p>
        <h3>Series 1</h3>
        <p>
          The first series features twenty-eight characters in all; eighteen
          Autobots and ten Decepticons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Optimus Prime is the Autobot Commander and transforms into a tractor
          trailer truck - specifically a Freightliner COE 1980. While in its
          robot form, the toy consists of three separate parts: the main figure,
          which transforms into the cabin of the truck; an Autobot Headquarters,
          which transforms into the tractor trailer, serves as a combat deck,
          and includes a mechanic/artillery robot; and a small scout car named
          Roller, which launches from the Autobot Headquarters.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eleven Autobot cars consist of Bluestreak, Hound, Ironhide, Jazz,
          Mirage, Prowl, Ratchet, Sideswipe, Sunstreaker, Trailbreaker, and
          Wheeljack.[6] Bluestreak, the gunner, transforms into a Datsun
          Fairlady 280ZX;[7] Hound, the scout, transforms into a Mitsubishi J59
          Jeep;[8] Ironhide, who serves as security, transforms into a 1980
          Nissan Onebox Cherry Vanette;[9] Jazz, the special operations expert,
          transforms into a 1976 Porsche 935 Martini (#4); Mirage, the spy,
          transforms into a Ligier JS11 Formula 1 Racer;[10] Prowl, the military
          strategist, transforms into a Datsun Fairlady 280ZX Police
          Cruiser;[11] Ratchet, the medic, transforms into a Nissan Onebox
          Ambulance Vanette;[12] Sideswipe, a warrior, transforms into a
          Lamborghini Countach prototype crafted from the LP500S model;[13]
          Sunstreaker, who is Sideswipe's twin brother, and is also a warrior,
          transforms into a Lamborghini Countach LP500S;[14] Trailbreaker, the
          defense strategist, transforms into a Toyota Hi-Lux 4WD;[15] and
          Wheeljack, the mechanical engineer, transforms into a Lancia Stratos
          Turbo #539 "Alitalia".[16]
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost all of the first year Autobot cars were nearly identical in
          appearance to their Diaclone counterparts with the exception of
          Bluestreak and Ironhide. All box art as well as catalog and
          instructions for Bluestreak show a blue Fairlady Z with a silver hood.
          The toy itself was only sold in solid silver. There has been rumors of
          a "blue" Bluestreak being released in the US market but no boxed
          examples have been identified. Ironhide is a red Nissan Onebox Cherry
          Vannette and the Diaclone version was black.
        </p>
        <p>
          The six Autobot minicars consist of Brawn, Bumblebee, Cliffjumper,
          Gears, Huffer, and Windcharger.[17] Brawn, who serves in demolitions,
          transforms into a Land Rover Defender 4x4;[18] Bumblebee transforms
          into a Classic Volkswagen Beetle;[18] Cliffjumper, a warrior,
          transforms into a Porsche Turbo 924;[19] Gears, who serves as a
          transport and in reconnaissance, transforms into a 4WD off-road
          truck;[19] Huffer, the construction engineer, transforms into the
          cabin of a semi truck;[20] and Windcharger, a warrior, transforms into
          a Pontiac Firebird Trans Am.
        </p>
        <p>
          A yellow Familia 1500XG minicar dubbed "Bumblejumper" and later known
          as Bumper was released on Cliffjumper backer cards. No carded examples
          have been found with the minicar on a Bumblebee backer card.
        </p>
        <p>
          Megatron is the Decepticon Leader and can transform into three
          different types of guns; a Walther P38 handgun, a particle beam
          cannon, and a telescopic laser cannon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soundwave is the Decepticon Communicator and transforms into a
          microcassette recorder modeled after a 1980s Sony Walkman.[22] The
          five Decepticon microcassettes are Buzzsaw, Frenzy, Laserbeak, Ravage,
          and Rumble.[23][24] Buzzsaw, the spy, resembles a condor while in
          robot form and came packaged with Soundwave.[24] Laserbeak, who serves
          in interrogation, also resembles a condor while in robot form and was
          sold with Frenzy, who is a warrior.[25] Ravage, the saboteur,
          resembles a jaguar while in robot form and was sold with Rumble, who
          serves in demolitions.[26]
        </p>
        <p>
          The three Decepticon planes are Skywarp, Starscream, and
          Thundercracker. All three of them transform into F-15 Eagles. Skywarp
          and Thundercracker are both warriors, while Starscream is the
          Aerospace Commander.
        </p>
        <p>
          To save production costs in developing separate chassis for multiple
          toys, many of the G1 Transformers are simply re-painted or
          re-accessorized clones of one another. The physical actions to
          transform one or the other between modes was identical. For example:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Ironhide and Ratchet are functionally identical to one another.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cliffjumper, Bumblebee, Hubcap and Bumblejumper aka Bumper are all
            functionally identical to one another.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prowl, Bluestreak, and Smokescreen are functionally identical to one
            another.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trailbreaker and Hoist are functionally identical to one another.
          </li>
          <li>
            Grapple and Inferno are functionally identical to one another.
          </li>
          <li>Rumble and Frenzy are functionally identical to one another.</li>
          <li>
            Laserbeak and Buzzsaw are functionally identical to one another.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sideswipe and Red Alert are functionally identical to one another.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sideswipe and Red Alert are functionally identical to one another.
          </li>
          <li>Pipes and Huffer are functionally identical to one another.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Finally, Thundercracker, Starscream, and Skywarp are functionally
          identical to one another. The Series 2 Decepticon jets (Thrust, Dirge,
          and Ramjet) all share the same robot centerline of the Series 1 jets
          with different attachable wing accessories (Thrust's have molded
          (non-functional) vertical turbofans in them, Dirge's are elongated
          like a hyper-performance flyer, and Ramjet's have ramjets...
          obviously).
        </p>
        <p>
          As the series moved farther along beyond the first two series and new
          characters were introduced, this replication became fewer and farther
          between. The newer toys tended to share thematic processes (such as
          the Headmaster and Targetmaster lines) but the physical manipulation
          of the toy to transform it between modes was generally unique to that
          character.
